  <h3>Step 1: Charge Your Device</h3>
  <p>Before first use, we recommend fully charging your Black Hole device using the included USB-C cable. Connect it to any USB power source. The charging LED will turn red while charging and green when fully charged.</p>
  
  <h3>Step 2: Attach the Antennas</h3>
  <p>Screw the included SMA antennas onto the antenna connectors on the device. Make sure they're securely attached for optimal performance.</p>
  
  <h3>Step 3: Power On</h3>
  <p>Press and hold the power button for 3 seconds to turn on the device. The status LED will light up, indicating the device is powered on and booting up.</p>
  
  <h3>Step 4: Connect to the Web Interface</h3>
  <p>The Black Hole creates its own WiFi network named "BlackHole_XXXX" (where XXXX is a unique identifier). Connect to this network using your computer or mobile device. The default password is "blackhole".</p>
  
  <h3>Step 5: Access the Control Panel</h3>
  <p>Open a web browser and navigate to <code>http://192.168.4.1</code>. This will open the Black Hole control panel, where you can access all features and settings.</p>
