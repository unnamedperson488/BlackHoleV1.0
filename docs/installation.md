  <h2 class="section-title">Hardware Setup</h2>
  
  <h3>Physical Installation</h3>
  <p>Setting up your Black Hole device is straightforward:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Unbox the device:</strong> Carefully remove all components from the packaging.</li>
    <li><strong>Attach antennas:</strong> Screw the included SMA antennas clockwise onto the antenna connectors until finger-tight. Do not overtighten.</li>
    <li><strong>Charge the battery:</strong> Connect the USB-C cable to the device and a power source. The red charging LED will illuminate while charging and turn green when fully charged (approximately 2-3 hours for a full charge).</li>
  </ol>
  
  <div class="faq-item">
    <p class="faq-question">Antenna Positioning</p>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>For optimal performance, position the antennas at a 90Â° angle to each other. This orientation provides the best signal reception and transmission capabilities across both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.</p>
