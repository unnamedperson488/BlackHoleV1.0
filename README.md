## ‚ö° How to Flash Firmware

### üîπ ESP32 Flashing

1. Hold the **boot button** (center) while pressing **reset**.
2. Connect to PC via USB-C.
3. Flash using [esptool.py](https://github.com/espressif/esptool), [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), or Arduino IDE.

Example:
```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32 --port COM3 write_flash 0x1000 firmware.bin
```

### üî∏ BW16 Flashing

1. Connect BW16's UART pins to a USB-to-TTL adapter.
2. Use [ambd_flash_tool](https://github.com/ambiot/ambd_flash_tool) or Ameba SDK to upload firmware.
3. Follow specific BW16 bootloader sequence instructions in [FLASHING.md](FLASHING.md).
